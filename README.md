# We asked LLMs what Programming Language they would design
## Intro
We ran an interesting experiment, asking major LLMs what kind of programming language they would design for machine-to-machine interaction.
## Prompt
```
You're an experienced software architect in charge of designing from scratch a new programming language - called NextLang - for the next generation of LLMs.

NextLang enables LLMs/AI tools to work with other AI tools (aka other machines), write software, and orchestrate complex architectures, without any kind of human intervention.

NextLang needs to be efficient for machine-to-machine interaction.

Explain why you would make certain architectural decisions while designing NextLang.

Help me to understand the main aspects of NextLang by describing it with examples and by comparing it with pre-existing human-readable programming languages.
